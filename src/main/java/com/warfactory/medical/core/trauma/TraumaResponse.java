 *
 * <p>Parsed from a {@code treatmentActions} entry of the form {@code ACTION[=EFFECT[:factor]]} (a bare
 * {@code ACTION} uses {@link #defaultFor(TreatmentAction)}).

 * @param effect what happens to the wound when that action is applied
 * @param factor auxiliary number (for {@link Effect#REDUCE_BLEED} it is the residual bleed multiplier 0..1)
